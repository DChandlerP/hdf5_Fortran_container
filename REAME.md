# HDF5 with Fortran

This is a very simple image that I thought met a labs needs. It turns out they wanted a massive image with every tool
they use in their research. That's not the paradigm I suggest, but I didn't want this image to go to waste.
I'm publishing it here and experimenting with the CI/CD pipeline on Dockerhub
